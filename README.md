# Chemical-Reaction-Predictor-Understanding-C++-fundamentals-

A simple c++ program which takes the input of the reactants and provides the output/product of the chemical reaction.
Number of carbon atoms and the type of chemical reactant is taken as input and provides the product. 
It was developed to understand and tinker with the fundamentals of c++ language.
Also it only works for halogens !
It was implemented as mini project for 2nd semester of comp science in 2017.

Happy Coding !
